                <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <p>
                    Bun: 250g of all-purpose flour, 150ml of warm water, 1
                    tablespoon of baking powder, 2 tablespoon of sugar. <br />
                    Filling: 180g of minced meat, green onion, and ginger.
                </p>
                <h2>Cooking Procedures</h2>
                <p>
                    1. Dissolve the baking powder and sugar in warm water and
                    mix them well, let them stand for about 10 minutes. <br />
                    2. Add baking powder water into flour, knead it into a
                    smooth dough, and then put the dough in a warm and damp
                    place. <br />
                    3. Put green onion, minced ginger, a spoonful of salt, a
                    little sugar, cooking wine, a spoonful of soy sauce
                    together. Slowly mix them to make the filling watery, then
                    add a spoonful of cooking oil. <br />
                    4. Take out the dough after it is twice as large, punch out
                    the bubbles, and knead it well. <br />
                    5. Knead the dough into long strips, and cut it into 16
                    equal parts. Then roll a small dough into a round piece.
                    wrap the filling, knead it into a bun, and then put the
                    wrinkle face down. <br />
                    6. Cover the buns with a layer of damp gauze and let them
                    ferment for the second time for 15-20 minutes. <br />
                    7. Pour the oil in the frying pan, soak the bottom, and cook
                    until the bottom is golden, then add half a bowl of water,
                    put a lid on top of frying pan and cook until the water is
                    almost dry, and finally sprinkle with green onion and
                    sesame.
