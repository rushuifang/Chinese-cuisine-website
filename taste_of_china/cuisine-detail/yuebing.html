                <h2>Cooking Procedures</h2>
                <p>
                    1. Add water to the invert syrup and stir well. Add oil
                    again. After whipping thoroughly, add the salt and stir
                    well. Sift into the flour, mix well and knead the dough.
                    Cover it with plastic wrap, and relax for more than two
                    hours.<br />
                    2. All kinds of nuts should be peeled in advance, fried and
                    crushed.<br />
                    3. Pour the crushed nuts into the container, add white
                    granulated sugar, maltose, cooked flour, cooked oil and cool
                    water, stir evenly. <br />
                    4. Divide the loose cake crust into 30 grams per piece and
                    knead it round. Wuren stuffing is divided into 50 grams per
                    piece. <br />
                    5. Take a cake crust, pat it flat. Put it into the palm of
                    your left hand, push the stuffing inwards with your right
                    hand, and at the same time rotate the left hand to push the
                    crust evenly against the stuffing until it wraps the whole
                    filling. Close cake crust and roll them in the flour pile,
                    shake off the excess flour, and put it in the mold. <br />
                    6. Press down the mooncake crust with your hands evenly,
                    lift the mold and push out the mooncake. Place it in a
                    baking tray lined with tin foil. <br />
                    7. Preheat the oven at 180 degrees celsius. Take mooncakes
                    out after 5 minutes, let them cool down. Brush them with egg
                    yolk liquid. Put them in the oven again and lower the
                    temperature to 150 degrees. Bake for about 10 minutes until
                    the surface is evenly colored. <br />
                    8. After the mooncakes are cool, put them in a fresh-keeping
                    bag.
