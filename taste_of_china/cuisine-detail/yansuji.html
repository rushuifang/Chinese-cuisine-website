                <p>
                    Boneless chicken breast, Thai basil, one raw egg yolk, sweet

                <h2>Cooking Procedures</h2>
                <p>
                    1. Chop the chicken into small pieces.<br />
                    2. Marinate chicken: add two tablespoons of white wine, one
                    minced garlic, one teaspoon of five-spice powder, half
                    teaspoon of pepper, soy sauce, and about two tablespoons of
                    sugar.<br />
                    3. Mix them well by hand, seal and put them in the
                    refrigerator to marinate for one hour.<br />4. Add an egg
                    yolk to marinated chicken, and mix them well. <br />
                    5. Coat the chicken piece by piece with sweet potato powder.
                    After all are covered with the powder, let them stand for
                    ten minutes so that the powder will not fall off easily when
                    it is fried.<br />
                    6. Heat the oil on the pan to about 160 degrees celsius.
                    <br />
                    7. Put the chicken into the frying pan one by one, you can
                    add the larger pieces first.<br />
                    8. Don't flip the chicken immediately after it's in the pan,
                    wait for the chicken to float and come into shape. Then flip
                    the chicken to make sure they are golden on both sides.<br />
                    9. At this time, add the Thai basil in, and the aroma of the
                    basil will come out after frying. <br />
                    10. Pick up chicken and basil in about 5-10 seconds.<br />
                    11. Raise the oil temperature, put the chicken and the Thai
                    basil in the oil and fry for another 10 seconds until they
                    become crispy. Remove the chicken and the basil, drain the
                    oil, put chicken in a bowl, add the salt and pepper while
                    hot, mix them well and then serve. If you like it to be
                    spicy, sprinkle the right amount of chili powder.
