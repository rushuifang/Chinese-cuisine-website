                <h2>Cooking Procedures</h2>
                <p>
                    1. Prepare a big sesame fish head from the reservoir. Cut it
                    into halves after handling it cleanly. Put some ginger
                    slices and parsley on the bottom of the plate to remove
                    fishy smell. <br />
                    2. Put the processed fish on a plate and marinate with
                    cooking wine, salt, pepper, green onion, ginger and garlic
                    powder for 15 minutes. <br />
                    3. Next prepare the auxiliary soup for steamed fish: red and
                    green chopped pepper, minced ginger, minced garlic, green
                    onion and sugar. <br />
                    4. Pour the marinated fish into the soup. Spread the chopped
                    peppers separately, sprinkle with ginger, garlic, green
                    onion, a little sugar, and put it in a steamer boiled water
                    for 10 minutes. <br />
                    5. Drizzle some steamed fish sauce oil, re-sprinkle with
                    fresh chopped green onion, pour a little oil in the pot,
                    heat it. The fish head is soft and glutinous, fat but not
                    greasy, salty and slightly spicy.
