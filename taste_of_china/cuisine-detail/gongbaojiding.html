                    Chicken breast 200g, peanut kernel 100g, sugar 7g, soy sauce
                    10ml, water starch 10ml, pepper 3g, ginger 3g, garlic 3g,

                <h2>Cooking Procedures</h2>
                <p>
                    1. Wash and dry the chicken breasts, cut them into small
                    cubes of 1.5cm. Mix them in water with starch and soy sauce.
                    Stir well and marinate for 20 minutes. Wash the green onions
                    and cut into 1cm long segments. Cut off the ends of the
                    dried chili and remove the chili seeds. <br />
                    2. Mix water starch, soy sauce, salt, white sugar and
                    cooking wine in a small bowl, mix well to make seasoning
                    juice. <br />
                    3. Heat the oil in the hot pot on medium heat. Put the
                    peanut kernels when it is hot. Slowly reduce the oil to a
                    slight color on lower heat. Remove the drained oil and set
                    aside. <br />
                    4. Continue to heat the oil in the hot pot over medium heat.
                    Put the marinated chicken into it, and stir quickly until
                    loose. Wait for the chicken to be cooked, then remove and
                    drain the oil. <br />
                    5. Leave the bottom oil in the pot, put the peppers and
                    dried chili peppers in the heat. Fry them on low heat, and
                    then add the green onions, ginger, garlic and chicken. Stir
                    for 10 minutes. After the soup thickens, add peanuts and
                    stir fry for 5 minutes.
